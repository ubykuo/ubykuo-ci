ubykuo-ci
=========
Lighweight (~60MB RAM footprint) continuos integration service. A free and open source tool built as an alternative to monstruos Jenkins memory usage when working on resource-constrained environments.


Premises
========

 - Extra lightweight (less 60MB on ram): Jenkins eats more RAM than Chrome on average, even with their workers IDLE.
 - Build steps in source code: don't hide your build files behind build servers and SSH tunnels, let your team embrace DevOps culture and handle the build steps inside the project source.
 - Install & run: install as a .deb package, minimal configuration and run as a service.
 - Webhook first: prioritize Webhook usage over cron.
 - No master-slave architecture
 - GIT repositories & multibranch support
 - Slack notifications

Usage
=====
Create build.sh script in your project
Create .env config file in your project [optional] (will be injected in build script)

Create config.json file in daemon config (/etc/ubykuo-ci/config.json)
